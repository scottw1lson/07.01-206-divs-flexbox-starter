                <p>I was born in Stevenage, England. Throughout my childhood I <span>loved to play sports,</span> and so it's perhaps no surprise that I went on to study sports journalist at university. Now I work as a Senior Writer for GiveMeSport!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>My passion: Music! You'll never find me without earphones in. Some of my favourite artists include <span>Brockhampton, Mac Miller, Young Thug and Kanye West.</span> Yes, I like rap! Although thanks to my girlfriend, I'm now an Idles fan.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>A fun fact: I was the <span>chess champion</span> at my secondary school! I learned to play in primary school and really enjoyed playing. During lunch time at school, me and my friends would go to the library to play against each other.</p>
